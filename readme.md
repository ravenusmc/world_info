# World_info
## Intro

This is a Python/Panda's project that will look at world data. Like most of my
projects, I got the data from Kaggle. The specific link, to the page, is the
following: https://www.kaggle.com/joniarroba/65-world-indexes-gathered.

As I have stated in a lot of my previous projects, I have a background in
international relations and political science so all of my projects try to have
some type of political science angle.

The purpose of this project is quite simple. It basically displays, on a map,
information about the world which the user wants to see.
