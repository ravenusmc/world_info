# World_info
## Intro

This is a Python/Panda's project that will look at world data. Like most of my
projects, I got the data from Kaggle. However, the information was displayed
on the home page so I do not have a specific link to the data online.

As I have stated in a lot of my previous projects, I have a background in
international relations and political science so all of my projects try to have
some type of pol sci angle.

The purpose of this project is quite simple. It basically displays, on a map,
information about the world which the user wants to see.
